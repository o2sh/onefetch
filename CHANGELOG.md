## 2.13.0 (2022-10-21)

`onefetch` is now typically more than twice as fast when executing. This was achieved by reducing
allocations and switching to `gitoxide` for the most taxing tasks.

A new web interface [onefetch.dev](https://onefetch.dev) was developed where users can visualize an ASCII preview for all the programming languages currently supported by onefetch. Like the binary, the data is parsed from the `Languages.yaml` file.

### Fixes

- Commits replaced with `git replace` are now followed. This can be turned off by setting the
  `GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS` environment variable.
- Shallow clones are now detected and displayed as such. Previously it might have appeared that
  the commit count is the real even though it was truncated due to the shallow-ness of the
  repository.
  If a repository is shallow, `(shallow)` will appear after the commit count.

### Refactor

- git2 repository can now be owned by the `Repo` type
  Previously this wasn't possible as commits would be kept in `Repo`
  which would cause self-referential borrow check issues unless
  the git2 repository was kept outside.
- completely separate `Commits` and `Repo` structure
- put all commit-traversal related initialization into own struct
